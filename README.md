The main purpose of us in this project is to find a subset of incomperable nodes in terms of 2 attributes (distance and price) from a large set. We came up with 3 applicable and non-brute-force solutions which all have relatively small time complexities. The best algorithm we found (method 2) has O(n) time complexity.

## Method 1: Sort and Compare ##
**Time Complexity:** O(nlgn)

## Method 2: The Best Solution ##
**Time Complexity:** O(n)

## Method 3: Convex Hull -A Promising Alternative Algorithm- ##
**Time Complexity:** O(nlgn)
