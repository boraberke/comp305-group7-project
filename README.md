# COMP 305 Group7 Project: Which Course Center Should I Select?
This is a group project for "COMP305: Algorithms and Complexity" class.
The main purpose of us in this project is to find a subset of incomperable nodes in terms of 2 attributes (distance and price) from a large set.
We came up with 3 applicable and non-brute-force solutions which all have relatively small time complexities. The best algorithm we found (method2) has O(n) time complexity.
